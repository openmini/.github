# openmini
an answer to "how can I make a high-quality mobile device with a low budget?"

openmini started out with a simple question: "why aren't there any high-quality, budget-friendly graphing calculators? it can't be that hard to make one, right?"  
thus, opengrcalc (the predecessor to openmini) was born, in an attempt to make a graphing calculator more powerful than TI's, with a price lower than Casio's.  
as I added more features to opengrcalc, I realized that it was slowly becoming less like a graphing calculator, and more like a general purpose mobile device.  
given that I planned to add even more features to the device, I decided it would be easier to extract opengrcalc's hardware and API and turn that into a set of specifications for just that - a general purpose mobile device.  
opengrcalc would then become a software package running on that open-source hardware specification, which I decided to call "openmini", bringing us to today.
